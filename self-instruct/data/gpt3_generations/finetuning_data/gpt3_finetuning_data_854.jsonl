You may also find that it helps to keep an exercise diary. Record what you did during each exercise session, how long you exercised, and how you felt afterward. \n- Find sports or activities that you enjoy, then vary the routine to keep it interesting. Remember, exercise doesn't have to be boring, and you're more likely to stick with a fitness program if you're having fun.  \n- Make physical activity part of your daily routine. If it's hard to find time for exercise, don't fall back on excuses. Schedule workouts as you would any other important activity. \n-  Some people find it helpful to work out with a friend. Invite friends or co-workers to join you when you exercise or go on walks. Work out with your partner or other loved ones.\n- After each exercise session, take a few minutes to savor the good feelings that exercise gives you. This type of internal reward can help you make a long-term commitment to regular exercise. External rewards can help too. When you reach a longer-range goal, treat yourself to a new pair of walking shoes or new tunes to enjoy while you exercise.\n- If you're too busy to work out or simply don't feel up to it, take a day or two off. Go easy on yourself if you need a break. The important thing is to get back on track as soon as you can.\nThere are a variety of ways to stay motivated during a workout. Find what works best for you and stick with it.<|endoftext|>"}

They are an informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea, which usually excludes dolphins and porpoises. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla, which consists of even-toed ungulates. Their closest non-cetacean living relatives are the hippopotamuses, from which they and other cetaceans diverged about 54 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), are thought to have had their last common ancestor around 34 million years ago. Whales consist of eight extant families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), Eschrichtiidae (the grey whale), Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales).\nOutput:", "completion": " science<|endoftext|>"}

{"prompt": "Conduct a scientific experiment to test a hypothesis and document your findings in a research report.

Two groups of plants were used, with one group exposed to classical music for 8 hours a day and the other group kept in silence. The height of the plants was measured daily for two weeks. The results showed that the plants exposed to music grew an average of 15% taller than those in silence.\n\nIntroduction:\nPlants are known to respond to various stimuli, including light, water, and nutrients. Some studies suggest that music can also affect plant growth. This experiment seeks to explore this relationship further by exposing plants to classical music and observing any changes in growth.\n\nMaterials and Methods:\n- Two groups of identical plants\n- Classical music playlist\n- Measuring tape\n- Watering can\n- Potting soil\n\nResults:\nThe plants exposed to music grew an average of 15% taller than the control group. This difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). The plants in silence showed normal growth patterns.\n\nConclusion:\nThe results of this experiment support the hypothesis that music can positively influence plant growth. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms behind this phenomenon.<|endoftext|>"}

Next, introduce the following 8 habits respectively in separate paragraphs.\n- reading\n- staying alive\n- remaining positive\n- respect\n- honesty \n- gratefulness\n- family togetherness\n- cleanliness\nOutput:", "completion": " Most parents are well aware that telling children what to do and how to act is far less effective than showing them what to do and how to act. Teaching children what is a good habit early in life works best when the habit or behavior is modeled by the parents themselves. Whether the child is 3 or 13, kids look to their parents for guidance, so consider these 8 great habits for kids to develop early in life.\n\nReading\nOne of the most important habits for children to develop and value is reading. Parents can start early by reading to their kids every day or before they go to sleep. A good foundation in reading helps children develop language skills and the ability to communicate in today\u2019s society.\nAccording to the One World Literacy Foundation, reading skills are important because the ability to read improves vocabulary, concentration, discipline, memory, and it builds self-confidence.\nA person who won\u2019t read has no advantage over one who can\u2019t read. -Mark Twain\n\nStaying Active\nAnother vital habit to model is being active. Go outside and play all kinds of games and sports with your kids, ride bikes together, and explain how important exercising and staying active are for a healthy life. Kids who are active are less likely to develop obesity or sleep issues.\nIn addition, avoid being a couch potato yourself. Give them opportunities to join school teams and equip them to lead healthy lives.\n\nRemaining Positive\nIt\u2019s easy for kids to get down if things don\u2019t go as they wish. Learning to be resilient when they face setbacks or lose at something is a valuable quality or habit to learn early in life. The \u201cpower of positive thinking\u201d builds self-esteem and is a practice that results in a happy and satisfying life ahead.\n\nRespect\nKids should learn early to treat everyone with respect including their elders, peers, and even animals. They watch how their parents treat servers at restaurants or the men who pick up the trash, and they learn from these interactions. Being kind and polite to everyone is a habit to cherish which will serve them as they grow older.\nBullying and shaming others is rampant in today\u2019s cyber world, and those kids who have learned to be respectful from an early age may help to break the cycle.\n\nHonesty\nAlways tell the truth. Own up to mistakes and accept the consequences. Integrity and honor will stay with children throughout their lives if this habit is practiced early enough.\nAlways do right. This will gratify some people and astonish the rest. -Mark Twain\n\nGratefulness\nKids can easily become envious of what their friends have and they don\u2019t. Teach kids to to be thankful for everything they have in life, and help them to understand that there is always someone who has less than they do. Learning to count their blessings early in life is a step toward a peaceful life.\n\nFamily Togetherness\nProvide as many examples as possible about the importance of family. Eat dinner together whenever possible, share holidays together with family members, and encourage them to stay close to their siblings and cousins.  \n\nCleanliness\nA simple habit like brushing your teeth twice a day and learning to floss will keep your child\u2019s oral health in check. Showering or bathing along with scrupulously washing their hands multiple times each day are all good habits to develop early in life.<|endoftext|>"}

Even if the premises are true, the conclusion might not necessarily follow.\n\n5. **Look for Hidden Assumptions and Implicit Premises:**\n   - Sometimes arguments rely on unstated premises or assumptions that need to be explicit for the argument to hold.\n   - Identify and scrutinize any hidden elements that might affect the argument's validity.\n\n6. **Consider Counterarguments and Alternative Explanations:**\n   - Evaluate whether other interpretations or conclusions might also logically follow from the same premises.\n   - Consider if there might be counterexamples that would undermine the premises or the conclusion.\n\n###<|endoftext|>"}

It led to the end of monarchy, the rise of democracy, and the establishment of the First French Republic. The revolution had a profound impact on France and the rest of Europe, inspiring other nations to fight for their own independence and leading to the spread of democratic ideals.\n\nOn the other hand, the Industrial Revolution, which began in Britain in the late 18th century, marked a shift from agrarian societies to industrialized ones. It brought about technological advancements, urbanization, and economic growth. However, it also led to poor working conditions, child labor, and environmental degradation.\n\nIn terms of long-term consequences, the French Revolution laid the foundation for modern democracies and human rights movements. It inspired revolutions across the globe and shaped the political landscape of Europe. The Industrial Revolution, on the other hand, transformed economies and societies, leading to the rise of capitalism and globalization. It set the stage for modern industrialized nations but also highlighted issues of inequality and exploitation.\n\nOverall, both events had significant long-term consequences on society, shaping the world we live in today.<|endoftext|>"}

{"prompt": "Summarize the following document with several bullet points.\nInput: WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A wide-open presidential race and a willingness by candidates, interest groups, unions and corporations to buy TV time will lead to historic spending for political and issue-advocacy advertising in the 2008 election cycle, an analysis shows. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney has spent the most on TV advertising so far among presidential contenders. The cost to try to influence the 2008 election could exceed $3 billion, according to TNS Media Intelligence/Campaign Media Analysis Group, CNN's consultant on political television advertising. This is nearly twice as much than what was spent in 2004 when political and issue-advocacy television advertising rang in at $1.7 billion. In 2006, $2.3 billion was spent on political and issue-advocacy TV commercials. Just about every candidate running for an office from dogcatcher to president is spending the money, said Evan Tracey, CMAG's chief operating officer. The costs to produce a TV commercial are no longer prohibitive for local and state candidates, who are turning more and more to the airwaves to reach voters. See how spending breaks down for this year \u00bb . And interest groups have spent $6.2 million on TV ads so far this year for state and local ballot measures. On the national level, the cost of issue-advocacy television ad spending was $270 million in the first nine months of this year. Subjects ranged from the Iraq war to telecommunications reform. Television ads on health care alone total $60 million. CMAG estimates more than $3 million of the $270 million spent to air issue-advocacy ads this year has gone for commercials in states and districts that are likely to have competitive House and Senate races in 2008. Tracey said he thinks this is just the beginning of interest groups \"pivoting from legislative advocacy mode to political mode.\" \"What we expect to see between now and the end of the primaries, and through the general election, is groups will take a more aggressive stance on their advertising and actually target candidates,\" he said. With 17 Democratic and Republican candidates running for president, CMAG predicts that more than $800 million will be spent on TV ads in the battle for the White House. Up to now, the political commercials have been largely focused on the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Voters in some of the 20-plus states holding nominating contests on February 5 will start seeing ads in the coming months. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney leads all candidates in TV spending, having aired his commercials more than 11,000 times this year at a cost of nearly $8.6 million. This is a record for the number of airings at this point in a presidential election cycle. Watch how Romney is way ahead in ad spending \u00bb . In contrast, one of Romney's chief rivals for the GOP nomination, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, has spent nothing on television ads, but Giuliani leads in the national polls and is within striking distance of the lead in several state surveys. Giuliani enjoys widespread national name recognition, while Romney does not. In the race for the Democratic nomination, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama has spent more than $2.3 million on television commercials, while New York Sen. Hillary Clinton has spent $1 million less and leads in both national and early state polls. New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson has probably benefited the most in the Democratic contest from the $2 million he has invested in his television commercials. Richardson's humorous TV ads effectively stated his experience as a lawmaker, diplomat and executive, and positioned him as a solid second-tier candidate. Romney used his $8.6 million in television ads to introduce himself as a social and fiscal conservative to Republican voters. These voters might otherwise not know much about him other than that he was the governor of the traditionally liberal Massachusetts. Romney is leading polls in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire. Further evidence of how Romney's television commercials have helped is in South Carolina. An American Research Group poll of South Carolina Republicans in August showed Romney registering at 9 percent with these influential primary voters. A month later, and with $350,000 worth of commercials aired in the two weeks leading up to the next poll, Romney was up 17 percentage points. Romney's latest ad began airing Friday in Iowa, and in it he vows to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, to boost the military by 100,000 people, to strengthen U.S. intelligence capabilities and to monitor calls into the U.S. from al Qaeda. All of these issues should play well with conservatives who participate in the Iowa caucuses. While only a handful of Democratic candidates and Romney have used the airwaves until now, Tracey said he expects this to change. \"Before the end of October, I suspect all the frontrunner candidates will be on the air,\" Tracey said. \"As we get closer to primary day, the frontrunners will be joined by all the candidates in the race who are taking their last, best shot.\" In the fight for Congress, CMAG predicts that as much as $639 million could be spent on television advertising. Democrats control the House and Senate. Tracey noted that CMAG's 2008 election cycle forecast does not take into account unforeseen events such as former Florida Rep. Mark Foley's House page scandal or the September 11 terrorist attacks. \"Politics is completely beholden to events,\" he said. \"Events will ultimately determine how much is spent, where and when.\" What television advertising challenges do candidates and interest groups face in the coming months? \"Chances are, just as what happened in 2006, voters will be numb after watching hundred and hundreds of ads,\" said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of the non-partisan Rothenberg Political Report. \"The sheer number of ads probably dilutes their importance. After a while, the ads just become lots of chatter and an ad will have to be really good to cut through the noise.\" E-mail to a friend .\nOutput:", "completion": " - Amount almost double what was spent in the 2004 election cycle.\n- Lower TV production costs help more candidates advertise.\n- Mitt Romney leads presidential candidates in TV spending.\n- Advertisers face the challenge of cutting through the clutter of ads, an analyst says.<|endoftext|>"}

{"prompt": "Task: Generate a title for the paper given a description or abstract of its content.\n\nAbstract: Fine-tuning continuous prompts for target tasks has recently emerged as a compact alternative to full model fine-tuning. Motivated by these promising results, we investigate the feasibility of extracting a discrete (textual) interpretation of continuous prompts that is faithful to the problem they solve. In practice, we observe a \"wayward\" behavior between the task solved by continuous prompts and their nearest neighbor discrete projections: We can find continuous prompts that solve a task while being projected to an arbitrary text (e.g., definition of a different or even a contradictory task), while being within a very small (2%) margin of the best continuous prompt of the same size for the task. We provide intuitions behind this odd and surprising behavior, as well as extensive empirical analyses quantifying the effect of various parameters. For instance, for larger model sizes we observe higher waywardness, i.e, we can find prompts that more closely map to any arbitrary text with a smaller drop in accuracy. These findings have important implications relating to the difficulty of faithfully interpreting continuous prompts and their generalization across models and tasks, providing guidance for future progress in prompting language models.\n\n", "completion": "Prompt Waywardness: The Curious Case of Discretized Interpretation of Continuous Prompts<|endoftext|>"}

In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories.
